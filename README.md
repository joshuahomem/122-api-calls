## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #122 API Calls

Objectives:
* Exploring encapsulation with limited integration between multiple programs
* Make use of the requests module to make calls to a REST API
* Explore data security and Github

API stands for "Application Program Interface", and it's a great example of what we call "encapsulation".  Encapsulation refers to creating modules within programs to keep data within a module secure and inaccessible from other applications.


An API is a program that provides data to another program.  In the example we will use today, we will use a weather API.  We can send requests to the weather API from Python and it will provide us with data in a specific format that we can use.  Our program and the weather program communicate through a very limited interface, and the code between each of them is secure.
